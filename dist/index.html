            large: Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to resuce it
            from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011,had built it into the world's most
            valuable company.Along the way he hepled to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies,
            music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of
            America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, nad WaltDisney. None of these men was a
            saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remmber how they applied imagination
            to technology and business. </p>

But they don't."Then he paused for a few moment and said, almost wistfully,And we got some amazing things done."Indeed ,he and Apple had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than ofany other innovative company in modern times:iMac,iPod nano,iTunes store,Apple Stores,MacBook,iPhone,iPad,App Store,OS X Lion - not to mention every Pixar film.And ashe battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and very loving wife,sister,and four children.  </p>
